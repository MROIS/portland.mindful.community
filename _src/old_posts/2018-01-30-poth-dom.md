Dear Friends,

You are warmly invited to come relax and renew, February 18, 10am-3pm for a Sunday in the country to refresh your soul. Our ongoing seasonal retreat days inspire peace in our lives and in this beautiful and crazy world.

Enjoy walking the trail and labyrinth, hearing dharma teachings and practicing transformative meditations, and contemplating our Midwinter theme: "Happiness is Here and Now.‚Äù 

There will be stress-relieving and body-centered techniques for all levels. Once here you may choose how to use this day, enjoying any of the offerings or spending time walking the land or sitting by the singing creek. Beginners and all practitioners welcome. No experience necessary. 

Spaces are precious: RSVP by 2/11 please. 

Suggested Dana donation: $50-$100 per person may be made on the day, self-determined sliding scale. Scholarships/energy exchange available. All are welcome, please feel free to ask for assistance.

In kindness and gratitude,
