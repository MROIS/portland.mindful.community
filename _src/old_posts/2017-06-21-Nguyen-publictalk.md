### Public Talk with Thu and Anh-Huong Nguyen
### August 2, 2017 - 7 PM 

**For A Future To Be Possible: The Wisdom of Interbeing**

How do we keep our hearts open during these challenging times, grow our loving kindness with so much division, and be true to ourselves during a time of turmoil? Mindfulness practice and the insight of Interbeing are the basis for transforming ourselves and creating harmony. Mindfulness relieves suffering because it is filled with understanding and compassion.

#### About the Teachers

Anh-Huong and Thu Nguyen  have been practicing mindfulness in the tradition of the Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh for 30 years.  They have led mindfulness retreats in the United States since 1988 and in 1992 were among the first students to be ordained as meditation teachers by Thich Nhat Hanh. Anh-Huong is the author of "Opening the Heart of Compassion", a guided meditation CD and co-author with Thich Nhat Hanh of "Walking Meditation", a multimedia manual on mindful walking. She has translated several of Thich Nhat Hanh's books into English, including "The Sun My Heart" and "The Diamond that Cuts through Illusion."
 
In 1998, the couple moved to Woodstock, Vermont to help start the first Mindfulness Practice Center in Plum Village tradition. By the end of 1998, after returning home in Northern Virginia, they founded the Mindfulness Practice Center of Fairfax.  This is their first visit to the West Coast.
