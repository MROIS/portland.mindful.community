A four day retreat for people from all walks of life, where adults and children can learn practical ways to live more peaceful, centered lives with each other and the natural world. This retreat will be led by monks and nuns from Deer Park Monastery. 

The weather should be warm and we will have 2 miles of wild Oregon coastline to explore, beach fires to sing around, delicious local foods to eat and comfortable, rustic cabins and lodges to stay in.

This event is being developed and hosted by interfaith organizations throughout Oregon and Washington. The retreat will be lead by Monastic Dharma Teachers from Deer Park Monastery. They have been ordained and trained by Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh. A children’s program will be offered.

The 529 acre Westwind site is located within a United Nations Bio-Sphere which lies 50 miles due West of Salem on Oregon’s central coast. (We will pick you up by ferry and transport you across the Salmon River to Westwind).
