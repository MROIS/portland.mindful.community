9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. 

Sponsored by the Thursday Night Sangha and Refuge of the Heart Sangha.
All are welcome!

Lludrum Chodon will lead a day of mindfulness on how to lovingly accept people as they are, knowing that they, and you, are perfect.  In our world of suffering, and in how we engage for social change, the practices of acceptance and self-forgiveness have special meaning.

She will introduce a 10-point mindfulness practice with questions to help us develop a wider worldview. The practice shines a light on the hidden prejudices and stuck points, and helps us to develop a flexible mind capable of living with not knowing.

Venerable Chodon is a Buddhist nun who has been teaching since 1990. She has studied and taught Dharma throughout the U.S. and internationally. She received her Bhikshuni ordination from Thich Nhat Hanh. As a teacher, Ven. Chodon uses gentle humor and practical examples to help others benefit from the application of Buddhist wisdom to daily life.
