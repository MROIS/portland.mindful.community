## **This retreat is only open to Order of Interbeing Members and Aspirants**

Dear friends,

I hope the evening finds you well and snug and at ease. 

I'm writing to let you know registration is open for the winter retreat at St. Benedicts.  the dates are the evening of Wednesday January 17 through noon the 21st for OI and the evening of the 19th through noon on the 21st for aspirants. The cost is $35 dollars a night. Food will be done cooperatively as we have done in the last couple of years. 

This retreat will be co-created.  If you have ideas about leading a practice experience let me know.  

To register send me a check for $50 for your initial payment.  The balance due at the event itself.  let me know how many nights you will be staying. 

Once I know who is coming when, I will figure out the food assignments.  It has worked for folks from one area to be responsible for one set of meals. 

You can send the checks to me at the following address:

Lucy Kingsley
781 Cherry Ave
Eugene, Oregon 97404

If you want to reach me more directly I can be contacted by phone at
