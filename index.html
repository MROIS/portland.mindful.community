                </p>

                  There are several Sanghas which meet weekly in the Portland area, and you can read more about <a href="/where">Where to Practice</a>. There is also information about the mindfulness tradition established by <a href="/thich-nhat-hanh">Thich Nhat Hanh</a>, and upcoming opportunities to practice in community and participate in other regional <a href="https://events.mindful.community">events</a>, such as retreats and days of mindfulness.

                  <em>“What we should ask ourselves is if we are practicing love for ourselves, because to love ourselves means to love our community. If we’re able to love ourselves, to nourish ourselves correctly, to not intoxicate ourselves, we’re already protecting and nurturing our society. Because the moment we’re able to smile, to look at ourselves with compassion, our world begins to change.”</em> Thich Nhat Hanh
