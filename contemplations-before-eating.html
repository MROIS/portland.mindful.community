                  This food is a gift of the earth, the sky, numerous living beings, and much hard and loving work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  May we eat with mindfulness and gratitude so as to be worthy to receive this food.
                </p>
                <p>
                  May we recognize and transform unwholesome mental formations, especially our greed and learn to eat with moderation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  May we keep our compassion alive by eating in such a way that reduces the suffering of living beings, stops contributing to climate change, and heals and preserves our precious planet.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We accept this food so that we may nurture our brotherhood and sisterhood, build our Sangha, and nourish our ideal of serving all living beings.

                  <em>As a spiritual family and a human family, we can all help avert climate change with the practice of mindful eating. Going vegetarian may be the most effective way to stop climate change. Being vegetarian is already enough to save the world. "</em> - from Thich Nhat Hanh’s 2007 “<a href="http://plumvillage.org/letters-from-thay/sitting-in-the-autumn-breeze/" target="_blank">Blue Cliff Letter</a>”
