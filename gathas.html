                <p>
                  One way to help us dwell in the present moment is to practice reciting gathas or mindfulness verses. When we practice with gathas, the gathas and the rest of our life become one and we live our entire lives in awareness. There are many gathas, you begin with one or two and learn more over time.

                <h4><strong>Waking Up</strong></h4>
                <p>
                  Waking up this morning I smile <br />
                  24 brand new hours are before me.<br />
                  I vow to live fully in each moment <br />
                  And look upon all beings with the eyes of compassion.
                </p>
                <h4><strong>Sitting Down</strong></h4>
                <p>
                  Sitting here is like sitting under the Bodhi tree.<br />
                  My body is mindfulness itself, <br />
                  Calm and at ease, <br />
                  entirely free from distraction.
                </p>
                <h4><strong>Walking Meditation</strong></h4>
                <p>
                  I have arrived, I am home<br />
                  In the here, in the now <br />
                  I am solid, I am free<br />
                  In the ultimate, I dwell.
                </p>
                <h4><strong>Letting Go</strong></h4>
                <p>
                  Hearing the bell,<br />
                  I am able to let go of all afflictions.<br />
                  My heart is calm, my sorrows ended. <br />
                  I am no longer bound to anything. <br />
                  I learn to listen to my suffering <br />
                  and the suffering of the other person. <br />
                  When understanding is born in me, <br />
                  Compassion is also born.
                </p>
                <h4><strong>Experiencing emotions</strong></h4>
                <p>
                  Feelings come and go <br />
                  like clouds in a windy sky. <br />
                  Conscious breathing <br />
                  is my anchor.
                </p>
                <h4><strong>Looking in the Mirror</strong></h4>
                <p>
                  Awareness is a mirror <br />
                  reflecting the four elements. <br />
                  Beauty is a heart that generates love <br />
                  and a mind that is open.
                </p>
                <h4><strong>Turning on the Tap</strong></h4>
                <p>
                  Water comes from high mountain sources.<br />
                  Water runs deep in the Earth. <br />
                  Miraculously water comes to us and sustains all life.<br />
                  My gratitude is filled to the brim.
                </p>
                <h4><strong>Brushing your teeth</strong></h4>
                <p>
                  Brushing my teeth and rinsing my mouth, <br />
                  I vow to speak purely and lovingly. <br />
                  When my mouth is fragrant with right speech, <br />
                  a flower blooms in the garden of my heart.
                </p>
                <h4><strong>Drinking Tea</strong></h4>
                <p>
                  This cup of tea in my two hands, <br />
                  mindfulness held perfectly. <br />
                  My mind and body dwell <br />
                  in the very here and now.
                </p>
                <h4><strong>Turning on the Light</strong></h4>
                <p>
                  Forgetfulness is the darkness;<br />
                  Mindfulness is the light <br />
                  I bring awareness<br />
                  To shine upon all life.
                </p>
                <h4><strong>Using the Toilet</strong></h4>
                <p>
                  Defiled or immaculate,<br />
                  increasing or decreasing<br />
                  these concepts exist only in our mind. <br />
                  The reality of interbeing is unsurpassed.
                </p>
                <h4><strong>Good Night Gatha</strong></h4>
                <p>
                  Breathing in, I let go of my worries, my tensions. <br />
                  Breathing out, I touch Peace
