Buddhist Peace Fellowship, The Ziji Collective, and Interfaith Movement for Immigrant Justice (IMIrJ) invite all concerned about the criminalization of immigration to join in a monthly walk of compassion and solidarity. The goal is to have all four sides of the I.C.E. building wrapped in a continuous stream of compassion. Participants need not be Buddhists or member of any faith. Instruction in the practice of moving meditation will be given at the start of each event.
