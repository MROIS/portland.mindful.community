Reminder that the November 9, is the monthly Thawing ICE walking meditation vigil at the ICE headquarters at 4310 SW Macadam (Macadam and Bancroft) from 12-1 pm.  

The 4th Thursday is a vigil sponsored by IMIrJ at the same place from 10-11 am.

The documentary, Human Flow, by Ai WeiWei is about the movement of refugees around the world and is playing now at the Hollywood Theater.  This is a powerful message to reflect on.

IMIrJ meetings are the 2nd Tuesday of the month from 6:30-8:30 at St. Michael & All Angels Episcopal Church  1704 Northeast 43rd Avenue.
