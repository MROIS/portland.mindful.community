#### Registration Deadline May 1, 2017

Join us for a retreat in the tradition of Thich Nhat Hanh May 9-13, 2018 with Phap Vu and other monastics from Deer Park. 

Registration is at <http://events.constantcontact.com/register/event?llr=vkplmziab&oeidk=a07ef0c9qpt26e5e1b5>

#### Our Practice

This silent retreat (with time for sharing and discussion) allows us to let our minds and bodies rest in the present moment.  We will have sitting and walking meditation, silent meals, group discussion, working meditation, deep relaxation, and Dharma talks.  We cultivate a practice of mindfulness, ease and love.

#### Accommodations

Rooms will be double, triple, or quad occupancy.  Certain rooms have bunk beds. If you are physically able to use the upper bunk of a bunk bed, please let us know on the registration form as that will support the maximum number of retreatants.  We may have opportunities for couples to share their own double occupancy room. If this is desired, please let us know in the comments of the registration form. Read about the Alton L. Collins retreat center [ here ](https://collins.gocamping.org/).

#### Cost

Retreat registration is $525 with scholarships available.  The retreat registration only covers the cost of holding the retreat.  The monastery and personal retreat time for our Teachers are paid through your donations at the retreat.  We will have opportunities at the retreat to make donations for the teachers and the monastery.
