We are happy to invite you to our annual Oregon & SW Washington retreat.  We are fortunate to have Anh-Huoung and Thu Nguyen leading this year.  The retreat will be held at the lovely Alton L. Collins retreat center. The cost is $425 with scholarships available.

Anh-Huong and Thu Nguyen  have been practicing mindfulness in the tradition of the Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh for 30 years. They have led mindfulness retreats in the United States since 1988 and in 1992 were among the first students to be ordained as meditation teachers by Thich Nhat Hanh.

Anh-Huong is the author of "Opening the Heart of Compassion", a guided meditation CD and co-author with Thich Nhat Hanh of "Walking Meditation", a multimedia manual on mindful walking. She has also translated several of Thich Nhat Hanh's books into English, including "The Sun My Heart" and "The Diamond that Cuts through Illusion."

Because the Teachers are only available to visit the West Coast in August, this year's retreat will not be held at Great Vow Zen Monastery.  This also means a higher retreat cost for the commercial facilities. Please know registration funds for facilities costs and teacher transportation.   Our Teachers are paid through your Dana (donations) at the retreat.
