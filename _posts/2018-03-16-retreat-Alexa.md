##### September 13-16, 2018 (Registration Now Open)

Trout Lake Abbey & Retreat Center

Trout Lake, Washington

This creative retreat will have times for silence and deep practice as well as joyful times
for creative expression including moving, writing, soulcollage®, and ritual. We will study
and embody the attributes of the bodhisattvas as we cultivate our moment to moment
presence. 


Alexa Singer-Telles, LMFT, is a dedicated practitioner of mindful meditation and
the creative process. She co-founded the River Oak Sangha in 1991, she was
ordained into the core community of the Order of Interbeing in 2004 and received
Lamp Transmission from Thich Nhat Hanh to become a dharma teacher in 2014.
Her love of soul making through the creative process has been expressed in
leading groups using ritual, movement, art, and writing. She is a registered
facilitator of SoulCollage® and has taught dance and movement for experiencing
full embodiment for 40 years. Her intention is to bring the beauty of spirit into form
mindfully!
