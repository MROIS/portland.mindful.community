You are cordially invited to attend a weekend of silent practice and mindful living with local Sangha members in beautiful Trout Lake, WA. Trout Lake Abbey is a Vietnamese Thien Buddhist Temple, bed & breakfast, retreat center and organic farm with plenty of space to relax and abide peacefully in the moment. It features an exquisite view of Mt. Adams and is very rural. This retreat is being organized by Portland Thursday Night Sangha and will be led by Sangha members; the Sangha will be the teacher.

Accommodations and Costs:

There are bunk bed rooms inside the main house (aka the hostel), which have easy access to a shared restroom in the room.
There are also meditation huts outside (aka the huts), which can accommodate one person but require a walk to the restrooms. The meditation huts are small but have windows, heaters and a futon mattress.

There is also a larger meditation hut (aka Shakti hut), which has bunk beds and can sleep 6 people.

The cost for any of these are $100 for the weekend. Linens are pillows are provided unless you want to bring your own.

Another option is to stay in the B&B, which has 4 private bedrooms. The bathrooms are shared with 1 or 2 other people, except for the master suite. The cost for the B&B varies from $95 to $125 per night. Contact the Abbey directly to reserve.

Camping is another option if you prefer to do that and that will reduce the price to $40 for the weekend.

You do not need to decide on your accommodation at the time of registration, unless you wish to have a private bedroom in the B&B. Contact the Abbey directly to reserve a room and let us know. It would be helpful to let us know if you have a preference or particular need in regards to your accommodations so we can be aware of that.
