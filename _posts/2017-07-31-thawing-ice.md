All concerned about the criminalization of immigration are invited to join in a silent monthly walk of compassion and solidarity.

Thirty people participated in our first walk in July. With 120 people, we can wrap the building. 
 
The next mindful walks are the 2nd Thursday in August and September -- August 10 and September 14 --   at the ICE processing center 4310 SW Macadam at John’s Landing. 

Participants need not be Buddhists or member of any faith. Instruction in the practice of opening our hearts to transform suffering through peace-walking meditation will be given at the start of each event.
 
May our united action share burdens, cast light, and transform this time we live.
 
Co-sponsored by the Buddhist Peace Fellowship and Interfaith Movement for Immigrant Justice. The Thursday Night Sangha and Joyful Refuge Sangha, which are members of the Interfaith Movement for Immigrant Justice New Sanctuary project.
