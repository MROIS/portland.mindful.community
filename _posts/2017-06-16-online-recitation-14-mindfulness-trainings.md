We are happy to share a new opportunity for coming together to recite our beautiful bodhisattva blueprint for life:
The 14 Mindfulness Trainings, deep precepts we received from Thay, passed down from the Buddha to benefit our precious world.

Pacific Northwest-based online 14 Mindfulness Trainings recitation, all welcome
3rd Tuesdays 7-8 PM Pacific time, starting June 20.

We will come in on the Zoom platform meeting program by computer or phone.
It is a simple process — we just need to click on the link and come into the online sangha by phone, ipad, or computer.
Jayna’s community, People of the Heart, will pay the $14.99 monthly use fee and we would welcome dana to support this effort.
If you wish to make a donation over the coming months you may do so at: <http://www.peopleoftheheart.com/contribute.html>

We have these requests: Will you please share with your local Sangha members, listserves or email list groups?
This offering is not limited to OI members, it is also open to aspirants and practitioners.
OI members though will be invited to help with the readings. We will use an abbreviated format of the 14 Mindfulness Trainings
we received from Dharma teacher Kenley Neufield who’s been overseeing once a month, early Sunday morning,
phone-in recitations. Please let us know if you would like to volunteer to read in upcoming months.
