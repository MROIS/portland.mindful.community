## with Kate Marchevskova & Eileen Kiera

The Buddhist practice of Sati (recollection, awareness, mindfulness) is a simple spiritual practice that leads to complete freedom of our hearts and minds. With awareness, our mind opens to greater understanding and calm. Within the heart of Sati, we become more free of reactivity, and dwell in our natural abode of goodwill, love and compassion. On this silent retreat, we will engage with an open heart, and clear mind in the spaciousness of each moment in order to touch that which is most true about ourselves, each other and the world that we live in.
