### Facilitated by Apprentice Dharma Teacher Jon Prescott

'This too shall pass.'  These words comfort us during difficulty but also remind us that everything we hold dear will eventually pass away.  The Buddha called this passing 'the truth of impermanence.'  Join us as we explore how this inconvenient truth, so filled with suffering, also offers liberation.
 
The Day will include guided meditation, Dharma Talk, sitting and walking meditation and personal time for reflection and discussion.  The energy of the group practicing together is a wonderful supportive experience.
 
BRING a Sack Lunch .  Tea and Snacks will be available.  Some people like to bring a small lap blanket for relaxation. Please bring a notebook and pencil if you want to write during personal time.
 
A basket will be available in which to put DANA/a donation, in appreciation for our Teacher’s  Offering and a basket will be available for Dana to the Sangha.
