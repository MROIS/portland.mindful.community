                  Breathing in, breathing out<br />
                  I am blooming as a flower.<br />
                  I am fresh as the dew.<br />

                  what is real, what is true.<br />
                  And I feel there is space<br />
                  deep inside of me<br />
                  I am free, I am free, I am free.

                  In concentration, our hearts are at peace,<br />
                  a half-smile is born upon our lips.<br />
                  This is a new day. We vow to go through it in mindfulness.<br />
                  The sun of wisdom has now risen, shining in every direction.<br />
                  Noble Sangha, diligently bring your mind into meditation.</p>

                  With posture upright and solid, we are seated at the foot of the Bodhi tree.<br />
                  Body, speech, and mind are one in stillness; there is no more thought of right and wrong.<br />
                  Our mind and body dwell in perfect mindfulness.<br />
                  We rediscover our original nature, leaving the shore of illusion behind.<br />
