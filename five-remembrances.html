                  I am of the nature to grow old.<br />
                  There is no way to escape growing old.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am of the nature to have ill health.<br />
                  There is no way to escape ill health.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am of the nature to die.<br />
                  There is no way to escape death.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All that is dear to me and everyone I love are the nature to change.<br />
                  There is no way to escape being separated from them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My actions are my only true belongings.<br />
                  I cannot escape the consequences of my actions.<br />
                  My actions are the ground upon which I stand.
